  <p>2.<u>Types of Electronic Communications You Will Receive</u>:
  </p>
  <p>You understand and agree that we may provide documents to you in electronic format and forego paper copies of documents, agreements, disclosures, notices, and other information and communications regarding your account(s), services and products, the use of our websites or our other electronic services, your relationship with us, and/or other programs, products or services that are or may be in the future made available to you (collectively, "Communications").

  <p>We will not furnish paper copies unless you request them, except where we determine, in our sole discretion, we are required to deliver in paper form under applicable law or where we determine that you should receive Communications in paper rather than electronic form.  If we determine paper copies should be provided, we will also determine, in our sole discretion, whether to deliver paper copies to you in-person,  to mail them to your primary physical mailing address appearing in our records, or otherwise deliver them as required by law or any applicable governing agreement.
  </p>
  <p>4.<u>Obtaining Paper Copies</u>:

  </p>
  <p>If Communications sent to you by e-mail reference certain websites containing terms and conditions, you agree that you will review the content and that providing you with the website address constitutes provision of those terms and conditions via electronic means.  We recommend that you print or download a copy of this Consent and all other Communications we furnish and retain them in a secure place.

  <p><strong>FOR CONSUMERS WITH A MAILING ADDRESS IN CALIFORNIA</strong>
  </p>
  <p><strong>THIS DISCLOSURE IS PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES ACT</strong>
  </p>
  <p>In order to evaluate your application, FORTIFI FINANCIAL, INC. (“FortiFi”) may request a consumer credit report about you from a consumer reporting agency.
  </p>
  <p>CoreLogic Credco, LLC is the consumer reporting agency that will prepare or assemble the reports for FortiFi. The address and phone number for CoreLogic Credco, LLC are P.O. Box 509124, San Diego, CA 92150, 800-637-2422 (for credit report inquiries) or 877-532-8778 (for consumer file inquiries).
  </p>
  <p>The consumer report may contain information bearing on your creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, and may be used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing your eligibility for credit. The types of information that may be obtained include, but are not limited to: social security number verifications; address history; credit reports and history; and credit standing.
  </p>
  <p>You may request more information about the nature and scope of the consumer report by contacting FortiFi.<br>

  <p><strong></strong><strong>NOTICE</strong><strong> TO THE PACE ASSESSMENT APPLICANT</strong><strong></strong>
  </p>
  <p>In connection with your Application for PACE assessment financing, FortiFi must disclose to you the score that a credit bureau distributed to users and was used in connection with your Application, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.
  </p>
  <p>The credit score is a computer-generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on information a credit bureau has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. FortiFi uses the information in your credit report to assist us in determining whether you will obtain PACE financing. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.
  </p>
  <p>Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.
  </p>
  <p>If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the credit bureau at the address and telephone number provided with this notice. The credit bureau plays no part in the decision to take any action on the Application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on an Application.

  </p>

fl_modal_50: |
  <p><strong>NOTICE TO THE HOME LOAN APPLICANT</strong><strong></strong><br>
  </p>
  <p>In connection with your application for a home loan [which includes a closed-end loan or establishment of an open-end loan for a consumer purpose that is secured by one to four units of residential real property], Fortifi must disclose to you the score that a credit bureau distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on information a credit bureau or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.
  </p>
  <p>Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.
  </p>
  <p>If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the credit bureau at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The credit bureau plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.
  </p>
  <p>If you have questions, contact Fortifi.
