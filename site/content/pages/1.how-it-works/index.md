      <p>"I was not aware of FortiFi’s PACE financing until hearing about it from a friend. The rates are great, and the process was very simple! Our goal is to make our home more energy-efficient, and FortiFi has made this possible. We will definitely be using FortiFi again for our next energy-efficiency project. It’s been an all-around pleasant experience."
